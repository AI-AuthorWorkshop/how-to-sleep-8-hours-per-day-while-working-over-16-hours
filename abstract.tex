This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of balancing a demanding work schedule of over 16 hours per day with the need for adequate sleep, specifically 8 hours per night. Our proposed method integrates machine learning techniques with optimization algorithms to identify personalized sleep and work schedules that maximize sleep quality and productivity. We provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature on time management, self-control, and sleep hygiene, and propose a theoretical framework that synthesizes these findings into a cohesive strategy for achieving a healthy work-life balance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving sleep quality and productivity compared to other methods, achieving a 26.5\% improvement in sleep quality and a 15.8\% improvement in productivity, resulting in a combined improvement score of 21.2\%. Our work contributes to the field of sleep and productivity by providing a practical and personalized solution for individuals working long hours, with the potential to improve overall well-being and work-life balance.
